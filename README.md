How to use
------
First thing you will need to do is to:

1. go to the bot
2. go to profile and put your MSM Friend Code and Platform, (which is required so we can send you your gems correctly.)

Then follow these steps:

1. Click shop
3. Click the product type you want to purchase
4. Pick an amount of gems
5. Start the purchase
6. Make sure to confirm your MSM Friend Code & Platform is correct!! You ***cannot*** get a refund in any case but for [certain cases](#my-order-wasnt-sent-i-want-a-refund), you can change your Friend Code to the correct one.
   
> [!WARNING]
> Double check your MSM Friend Code and Platform before saving!

8. Pay your invoice
9. Wait a few minutes for your gems to be sent to your account
10. You can view the tracking of your order (how many gems you've recieved so far) and your previous orders

##### Now, after all of that, you should have your gems!

Redeemable Codes
------
In the home section of the MSM Gem Shop, you are able to input codes to get free gems! (You need your MSM Friend Code & Platform to be set first)

**Redeemable codes are commonly given out to youtubers to give to fans and get them to purchase from the shop, if you're a youtuber and want a code, contact me**

*Psst: use code **RELEASE** for 10 free gems!*

My order wasn't sent! I want a refund!
------
If you've ordered a product but haven't recieved it yet, please first:
1. **Check if your set MSM Friend Code is correct**
2. **Check if your set Platform is correct**

We aren't able to refund you, but we can give you your gems on a new Friend Code in certain conditions:

If you misspelled your id for example, lets say your id is 1112LE, but you misspell it as 2221EL, we cannot pay you with the new "fixed" id for security reasons.

**However,** if you set your id to something like "Fart Id2342" and forgot to change it before purchasing, we **can** give you the gems with a new fixed id for that.

Please make sure your ID and Platform is correct next time!
